Topic: "Two years ago, the nearby town of Ocean View built a new municipal golf course and resort hotel. During the past two years, tourism in Ocean View has increased, new businesses have opened there, and Ocean View's tax revenues have risen by 30 percent. Therefore, the best way to improve Hopewell's economy-and generate additional tax revenues-is to build a golf course and resort hotel similar to those in Ocean View."

As a mayor of a town, it is understandable that he wants to imitate what the nearby town did after it achieves success. However, reasons supporting the idea that building a golf course and resort hotel will lead to increase in economy are insufficient.

Firstly, the mayor finds that after the nearby town, Ocean View, builds a golf course and resort hotel, tourism there is augmented and there is a its 30 percent increase in its tax revenues, which leads to his argument that acting similarly can raise the economy. Nevertheless, such fact cannot support his view. The mayor attributes the increase in economy to the new golf course and hotel, but he doesn't take other facts into consideration. For example, it is possible that the new facilities only account for a small part in the increase and that retailing contributes a lot to the increase. Therefore, it is more convincing if the mayor provides how much the new business itself brings to the Ocean View.

Moreover, how much the 30 percent increase actually is remains unclear because the mayor doesn't mention the base number. For instance, if the tax revenues in mayor's town are originally 20 times more than Ocean View, a 30 percent increase in Ocean View's economy is so tiny to the mayor's town that it is not worth to act similarly as what Ocean View does. Such small increase has little effect on the mayor's town, so the mayor should provide the tax revenues of both towns for comparison to support his argument.

Finally, the mayor doesn't consider the competition with the Ocean View. If the mayor's town also has the golf course and the resort hotel, the two towns, of course, will be in competition of attracting tourists and many other factors. Now Ocean View has an advantage because it began the business two years earlier, so whether or not the mayor's town can earn profit after two years during which Ocean View improves its business and makes it more inviting remains a doubt. The mayor should come up with solutions to ensure the profit.

All in all, it is right for the mayor to find ways to raise the economy, but he should consider more details to make his argument more convincing.
