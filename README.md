# GRE-Writing-Group
*GRE writing exercise group in GAU Feiyang's team*

This repository is the archive for group members to submit their writing assignments. I will release two writing topics each week while the deadline of these two assignments is Thursday 22:00 and Sunday 22:00 respectively. We will discuss the writing assignments together after each deadline, about 22:00 - 23:00 at Thursday and Sunday evening.

## The Latest Topic Due at August 27

> Some people believe that our ever-increasing use of technology significantly reduces our opportunities for human interaction. Other people believe that technology provides us with new and better ways to communicate and connect with one another.

Write a response in which you discuss which view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should address both of the views presented.
