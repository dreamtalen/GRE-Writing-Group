# GRE-Writing-Group
*GRE writing exercise group in GAU Feiyang's team*

This repository is the archive for group members to submit their writing assignments. I will release two writing topics each week while the deadline of these two assignments is Thursday 22:00 and Sunday 22:00 respectively. We will discuss the writing assignments together after each deadline, about 22:00 - 23:00 at Thursday and Sunday evening.

## The Latest Topic Due at August 17

The following appeared in a recommendation from the president of Amburg's Chamber of Commerce.

> "Last October the city of Belleville installed high-intensity lighting in its central business district, and vandalism there declined within a month. The city of Amburg has recently begun police patrols on bicycles in its business district, but the rate of vandalism there remains constant. We should install high-intensity lighting throughout Amburg, then, because doing so is a more effective way to combat crime. By reducing crime in this way, we can revitalize the declining neighborhoods in our city."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.
