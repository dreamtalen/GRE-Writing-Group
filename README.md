*GRE writing exercise group in GAU Feiyang's team*

This repository is the archive for group members to submit their writing assignments. I will release two writing topics each week while the deadline of these two assignments is Thursday 22:00 and Sunday 22:00 respectively. We will discuss the writing assignments together after each deadline, about 22:00 - 23:00 at Thursday and Sunday evening.

## The Latest Topic Due at August 20
