# GRE-Writing-Group
*GRE writing exercise group in GAU Feiyang's team*

This repository is the archive for group members to submit their writing assignments. I will release two writing topics each week while the deadline of these two assignments is Thursday 22:00 and Sunday 22:00 respectively. We will discuss the writing assignments together after each deadline, about 22:00 - 23:00 at Thursday and Sunday evening.

## The Latest Topic Due at August 31

The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Parkville Daily Newspaper.

> "Throughout the country last year, as more and more children below the age of nine participated in youth-league softball and soccer, over 80,000 of these young players suffered injuries. When interviewed for a recent study, youth-league softball players in several major cities also reported psychological pressure from coaches and parents to win games. Furthermore, education experts say that long practice sessions for these sports take away time that could be used for academic activities. Since the disadvantages apparently outweigh any advantages, we in Parkville should discontinue organized athletic competition for children under nine."
